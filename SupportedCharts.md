This page contains the list of supported charts. However the plugin is built on a flexible way where most of the parameters received as input are just sent to the XML. **This means that other charts or widgets with a similar structure might already be supported.**


The following charts and widgets are supported when using the Licensed FusionCharts version. For more information about licensing check the [main](Main.md) page.
